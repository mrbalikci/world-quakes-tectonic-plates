# World Earthquakes with Techtonic-Plates


Illustrated the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.


## Basic Visualization


**The data set**

  * The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Visited the [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) page and picked a data set to visualize. 

  * Data on tectonic plates can be found at <https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates>.

**Imported & Visualized the Data**

   * Created a map with multiple layers using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.

   * The data markers reflected the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appeared larger and darker in color.

   * Included popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker was clicked.

   * Created a legend that will provide context for the map data.

   * Ploted a tectonic plates to the map.

   * Added a number of base maps to choose from as well as separate out our two different data sets into overlays that can be turned on and off independently.

   * Added layer controls to the map.
